" Abbreviations - General Editing - Inserting Dates and Times
" ===================================================================
"
" First, some command to add date stamps (with and without time).
" I use these manually after a substantial change to a webpage.
" [These abbreviations are used with the mapping for ",L".]
"
  iab Ydate <C-R>=strftime("%y%m%d")<CR>
" Example: 971027
"
  iab Ytime <C-R>=strftime("%H:%M")<CR>
" Example: 14:28
"
  iab YDT   <C-R>=strftime("%y%m%d %T")<CR>
" Example: 971027 12:00:00
"
  iab YDATE <C-R>=strftime("%a %b %d %T %Z %Y")<CR>
" Example: Tue Dec 16 12:07:00 CET 1997
"
" On Windows the functions "strftime" seems to have a different
" format.  Therefore the following may be necessary:  [980730]
" if !has("unix")
" iab YDATE <C-R>=strftime("%c %a")<CR>
" else
" iab YDATE <C-R>=strftime("%D %T %a")<CR>
" endif
"
" ===================================================================
" MAPpings
" ===================================================================
" Caveat:  Mapping must be "prefix free", ie no mapping must be the
" prefix of any other mapping.  Example:  "map ,abc foo" and
" "map ,abcd bar" will give you the error message "Ambigous mapping".
"
" The backslash ('\') is the only(?) unmapped key, so this is the best
" key to start mappings with as this does not take away a command key.
" However, the backslash is never in the same position with keyboards.
" Eg on German keyboards it is AltGr-sz - don't ask.
" Anyway, I have decided to start mappings with the comma as this
" character is always on the same position on almost all keyboards
" and I hardly have a need for that command.
"
" The following maps get rid of some basic problems:
"
" When the backspace key sends a "delete" character
" then you simply map the "delete" to a "backspace" (CTRL-H):
"  map <Del> <C-H>
"
" With Vim-4 the format command was just 'Q' and
" I am too used to it.  So I need this back!
  nnoremap Q gq
  vnoremap Q gq
"
" 980527 I often reformat a paragraph to fit some textwidth -
" and I use the following mapping to adjust it to the
" current position of the cursor:
  map #tw :set textwidth=<C-R>=col(".")<C-M>
"
" 981210 Whenever I paste some text into VIM I have to
" toggle from "nopaste" to "paste" and back again:
" map <f4>   :set paste!<c-m>:set paste?<c-m>
"  map <esc>[14~ :set paste!<c-m>:set paste?<c-m>
"
" "tal" is the "trailer alignment" filter program
" Hopefully it will ship with Vim one day.
" vmap #t !tal<CR>
" vmap #t !tal -p 0<CR>
"
" Disable the command 'K' (keyword lookup) by mapping it
" to an "empty command".  (thanks, Lawrence! :-):
" map K :<CR>
" map K :<BS>
" More elegant:  (Hi Aziz! :-)
" map K <NUL>
"
" Disable the suspend for ^Z.
" I use Vim under "screen" where a suspend would lose the
" connection to the " terminal - which is what I want to avoid.
" map <C-Z> :shell
"
" Make CTRL-^ rebound to the *column* in the previous file
  noremap <C-^> <C-^>`"
"
" Make "gf" rebound to last cursor position (line *and* column)
  noremap gf gf`"
"
" When I let Vim write the current buffer I frequently mistype the
" command ":w" as ":W" - so I have to remap it to correct this typo:
  nmap :W :w
" TODO:  Use the following (after some testing):
" command -nargs=? -bang W w<bang> <args>
"
" Are you used to the Unix commands "alias" and "which"?
" I sometimes use these to look up my abbreviations and mappings.
" So I need them available on the command line:
  map :alias map
  map :which map
"
" The command {number}CTRL-G show the current nuffer number, too.
" This is yet another feature that vi does not have.
" As I always want to see the buffer number I map it to CTRL-G.
" Pleae note that here we need to prevent a loop in the mapping by
" using the comamnd "noremap"!
  noremap <C-G> 2<C-G>
"
" 980311  Sourcing syntax files
" My personal syntax files are in ~/.P/vim/syntax/
" and I need a quick way to edit and source them.
  map ,SO :so ~/.P/vim/syntax/
"
" 980706  Sourcing syntax files from the distribution
" A nice and fast way to both source syntax files
" and to take a look at "what's there":
  map ,V  :so $VIM/syntax/
"
" 990614  Quick insertion of an empty line:
" nmap <CR> o<ESC>
" I find this convenient - but as I am also used to proceed to
" next line by pressing CR this often gives me new empty lines
" when I really do not need them.  :-(
"
" ===================================================================
" Customizing the command line
" ===================================================================
" Valid names for keys are:  <Up> <Down> <Left> <Right> <Home> <End>
" <S-Left> <S-Right> <S-Up> <PageUp> <S-Down> <PageDown>  <LeftMouse>
"
" Many shells allow editing in "Emacs Style".
" Although I love Vi, I am quite used to this kind of editing now.
" So here it is - command line editing commands in emacs style:
  cnoremap <C-A> <Home>
  cnoremap <C-F> <Right>
  cnoremap <C-B> <Left>
  cnoremap <C-E> <End>

" AutoCommands
" ===================================================================
"
" Autocommands are the key to "syntax coloring".
" There's one command in your vimrc that should
" load/source the file $VIM/syntax/syntax.vim
" which contains the definition for colors and
" the autocommands that load other syntax files
" when necessary, ie when the filename matches
" a given pattern, eg "*.c" or *".html".
"
" just load the main syntax file when Vim was compiled with "+syntax"
  if has("syntax")
      " The following sources the main syntax file,
      " ie. "$VIM/syntax/syntax.vim", see ":help :syn-on":
      syntax on
      " Redefine the color for "Comment":
      hi! Comment  term=bold  ctermfg=cyan  guifg=Blue
  endif
"
" Definition of an alternative syntax file:
" if has("syntax")
"   " Define the filename patterns for mail and news:
"   " MAILNEWSFILES... (missing, damn)
"   " Define the aucommand tow work on special files:
"     let aucommand = "au BufNewFile,BufRead ".MAILNEWSFILES
"   " execute the source command:
"     exe aucommand." source ~guckes/.P/vim/syntax/sven.vim"
"   "
" endif
"
"
" EXAMPLE: Restricting mappings to some files only:
" An autocommand does the macthign on the filenames -
" but abbreviations are not expanded within autocommands.
" Workaround:  Use "exe" for expansion:
" let aucommand = "au BufNewFile,BufRead ".MAILNEWSFILES
" exe aucommand." :map ,hi 1G}oHi!<CR><ESC>"
